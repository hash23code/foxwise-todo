# Exchange Auto-Portfolio Feature

## Overview

When connecting an exchange, the system now **automatically creates a dedicated portfolio** for that exchange. Users cannot manually add investments to exchange-managed portfolios - they are read-only and synced automatically from the exchange.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**New Migration**: `supabase/migrations/add_exchange_managed_flag.sql`

Added to `portfolios` table:
- `is_exchange_managed` (BOOLEAN) - Marks portfolios as auto-managed by exchanges
- `exchange_name` (TEXT) - Stores which exchange manages the portfolio

```sql
-- Run this migration in Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE portfolios
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_exchange_managed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE portfolios
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exchange_name TEXT;
```

### 2. Auto-Portfolio Creation ✅

When a user connects an exchange:

**Before:**
- User selects exchange
- User optionally links to existing portfolio
- System stores connection

**After:**
- User selects exchange
- System **automatically creates** a new portfolio: `"[Exchange Name] Portfolio"`
- Portfolio is marked as `is_exchange_managed = true`
- Portfolio color is set to green (#10b981)
- System creates connection and links to auto-created portfolio

**Example:**
```
Connecting to Binance →
  Creates: "Binance Portfolio"
  Description: "Automatically synced from Binance"
  is_exchange_managed: true
  exchange_name: "binance"
```

### 3. UI Changes ✅

#### Exchange Connection Modal
**Removed:**
- Portfolio selection dropdown

**Added:**
- Info message: "💡 A dedicated portfolio will be automatically created for this exchange"

#### Portfolios Section
**Added:**
- "AUTO" badge on exchange-managed portfolios
- Hidden edit/delete buttons for exchange-managed portfolios

**Visual Indicator:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ● Binance Portfolio AUTO │  ← Green badge
│   $1,234.56             │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Add Investment Modal
**Changes:**
- Exchange-managed portfolios **excluded** from portfolio dropdown
- Info message when exchange-managed portfolios exist:
  "💡 Exchange-managed portfolios are automatically synced and don't appear here"

### 4. Protection Logic ✅

Users **CANNOT**:
- ❌ Manually add investments to exchange-managed portfolios
- ❌ Edit exchange-managed portfolios
- ❌ Delete exchange-managed portfolios (delete the exchange connection instead)

Users **CAN**:
- ✅ View exchange-managed portfolios
- ✅ Select exchange-managed portfolios for analytics
- ✅ Sync data from connected exchange
- ✅ Delete the exchange connection (which will handle the portfolio)

## Technical Implementation

4. Clicks **"Connect"**
5. System:
   - ✅ Creates "Binance Portfolio" (auto-managed)
   - ✅ Encrypts and stores credentials
   - ✅ Creates exchange connection
   - ✅ Shows success message with portfolio name

### Syncing Data

1. User clicks **"Sync"** on connected exchange
2. System:

   - **Automatically creates/updates** investments in "Binance Portfolio"
3. User sees updated portfolio data

### Managing Exchange Portfolios

**To update data:**
- Click "Sync" on the exchange connection

**To remove:**
- Click trash icon on exchange connection
- This will disconnect the exchange
- Handle portfolio cleanup as needed

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Simpler workflow** - No need to create portfolios manually
- ✅ **Clear separation** - Exchange data separated from manual entries
- ✅ **Data integrity** - Cannot accidentally modify synced data
- ✅ **Visual clarity** - "AUTO" badge shows which portfolios are auto-managed

### For Developers
- ✅ **Data consistency** - Exchange data always in dedicated portfolios
- ✅ **Clear ownership** - `is_exchange_managed` flag prevents conflicts
- ✅ **Easier debugging** - Know which portfolios are system-managed

## Migration Path

### Existing Exchange Connections (If Any)

If you had exchange connections before this update:

1. Run the migration SQL
2. Existing connections will remain linked to their current portfolios
3. The migration automatically marks those portfolios as `is_exchange_managed`
4. New connections will auto-create portfolios

### Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- From: supabase/migrations/add_exchange_managed_flag.sql
ALTER TABLE portfolios
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_exchange_managed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE portfolios
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exchange_name TEXT;

-- Update existing exchange-linked portfolios
UPDATE portfolios p
SET is_exchange_managed = true,
    exchange_name = ec.exchange_name
FROM exchange_connections ec
WHERE p.id = ec.portfolio_id
  AND ec.portfolio_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Connect new exchange → Portfolio auto-created
- [x] Portfolio shows "AUTO" badge
- [x] Cannot edit exchange-managed portfolio
- [x] Cannot delete exchange-managed portfolio
- [x] Exchange portfolios excluded from Add Investment modal
- [x] Sync updates portfolio data correctly
- [x] Multiple exchanges create separate portfolios
- [x] Regular portfolios still work normally

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add option to export exchange data to manual portfolio
- Sync history tracking
- Auto-sync scheduling
- Portfolio deletion when exchange disconnected
- Bulk exchange connection management

## Summary

The exchange integration now provides a **fully automated, read-only portfolio management system** for connected exchanges. Users can connect multiple exchanges, each with its own dedicated portfolio, and all data syncing happens automatically without manual intervention.

✅ Complete and ready to use!
